                <h2>What Is a Dental Implant ?</h2>
                <h3>Dental implant involves replacing an extracted tooth with a metal stud or post 
                screwed right into the bone to serve as an anchor to the crown or false denture 
                that would otherwise not have anything to keep it situated right into the tooth 
                socket of your missing tooth. That’s the main appeal of a dental implant 
                procedure. The artificial teeth, denture, or crown, is plugged right atop the 
                stud. Meanwhile, the post itself is what makes your new teeth look and function 
                like real teeth. It’s the best alternative you have against bridgework that 
                doesn’t fit too well or dentures that have a tendency to fall off (because 
                they’re not permanently affixed to your gums and mouth anyway). Implants are 
                much more convincing as real teeth than detachable dentures or even crowns 
                placed atop dental bridges that require the dentist to destroy two adjoining 
                healthy teeth in order to place a false tooth or teeth between them and the gap 
                of missing teeth, hanging over them like a bridge of sorts.</h3>
                <br />
                <br />


                <h2>When Is This Used ?</h2>
                <h3>Implants, particularly the single-tooth variety, can be availed of by people who are 
                missing one or more teeth. It’s usually availed of by those who’ve lost teeth 
                and wish for a permanent teeth restoration solution that’s more dependable than 
                dentures or a dental bridge. It’s also used in order to replace missing teeth 
                with bone supports that have withered away due to periodontal disease.</h3><br />
                <br />


                <h2>Extraction :</h2>
                <h3>If your withered or dead tooth hasn’t been extracted yet, it should be extracted in order 
                to allow placement of your dental implant post. Naturally, you can put an 
                implant where there’s still a tooth available. Then again, you also have the 
                option to save the tooth with endodontic therapy or a root canal treatment.</h3><br />
                <br />

                <h2>Preparation :</h2>
                <h3>From there, your jaw will be prepped for surgery. You might need to get bone 
                augmentation through bone grafts as well to give the post enough bone and room 
                to anchor itself to your jaw. Without enough bone to embed the implant upon, the 
                implant will fail to stick.</h3>
                <br />
                <br />


                <h2>Surgical Insertion :</h2>
                <h3>The implant is surgically inserted into the tooth socket via an opening, your 
                dentist himself will make within the jawbone. This involves cutting away the gum 
                then drilling into the jawbone itself in order to place the stud or post into 
                the bone via screwing it into place. Healthy Surrounding Teeth: The natural 
                teeth and their supporting tissues near the tooth socket where the implant is 
                supposed to be inserted must be in excellent health and not suffering from 
                gingivitis or periodontitis. Otherwise, the dental implant procedure won’t succeed.</h3><br />
                <br />


                <h2>New Tooth Root :</h2>
                <h3>After implant integration has taken place, with the post becoming one with your 
                jaw bone, it will serve as your new tooth root for the crown that will be placed 
                atop or plugged into the stud. An abutment is required to support the connection 
                between crown and implant.</h3><br />
                <br />


                <h2>The More Preferable Crown:</h2>
                <h3>The cap or crown is more preferable to the denture or a false set of teeth 
                because it has a natural tooth look and it even feels like one of your teeth due 
                to its dental implant anchor. The abutment that connects the crown to the 
                implant also looks like a tooth, albeit smaller.</h3>
                <br />
                <br />


                <h2>Fills in Gaps and Restores Your Bite :</h2>
                <h3>Dental implants are also dependable because they fill in the gap left by the 
                missing tooth. If you leave the gap alone and decide to not go through a dental 
                implant procedure, your teeth will gradually move towards the gap to balance 
                your bite out, thus changing your jaw shape and teeth placement. Steps Facial 
                Structure Degradation: Implant dentistry can prevent your face, jawbone, and 
                chin from changing down the line in order to accommodate the gap from your 
                missing tooth. The more missing teeth you allow to remain missing, the more your 
                bone, facial, and jaw structure will change as you grow older.</h3><br />
                <br />


                <h2>Dental Implant Bridge :</h2>
                <h3>Even if it’s just a single-tooth stud type of implant, you can use it to replace 
                a whole row of missing teeth by placing two studs on opposite ends of the row to 
                create a bridge of sorts (as opposed to destroying existing teeth to serve as 
                placements for a dental bridge). Parts of an Implant A tooth restored by implant 
                dentistry is composed of the following parts.</h3>
                <br />
                <br />


                <h2>Implantm :</h2>
                <h3>The titanium stud, post, or implant is placed on the lower or upper jawbone 
                (wherever your missing tooth used to be, right into the socket). It’s the metal 
                anchor that doubles as your restored tooth’s new tooth root of sorts. This 
                titanium implant is what gives crown false teeth or dentures that extra natural 
                feeling when you wear them. This is in contrast to bridges that require you to 
                destroy healthy adjoining teeth or dentures that can get dislodged rather 
                easily.</h3>
                <br />
                <br />
                <h2>Abutment :</h2>
                <h3>This can be made of porcelain, surgical stainless steel, zirconia, gold, or 
                titanium. It’s screwed into the implant and serves as the filler or an adapter 
                that connects the crown to the implant. The substructure or connecting element 
                adds extra support to the crown as a supporting contact. This is the main 
                adapter of your implant setup that connects the implant with the crown better. 
                The abutment is necessary because it makes it harder for the crown to loosen up 
                or crack under biting pressure compared to simply slapping the crown into the 
                implant.<h3><br />
                <br />


                <h2>Crown :</h2>
                <h3>The crown is the part of the restored tooth that looks and is shaped like a 
                natural tooth. It serves as the cap that you put onto your implant in order to 
                serve as your replacement tooth. It’s made to be tough and it’s actually 
                replaceable in case it cracks. The crown is typically made of PFM (a metal 
                alloy) fused with porcelain so that you end up with a denture that’s arguably 
                tougher than your average tooth. This crown is cemented or screwed onto the 
                abutment. If screwed, the screw hole is covered with a restorative material used 
                in filling cavities (composite). The Implant Process In regards to the implant 
                process itself, here’s a step-by-step guide you can follow in order to properly 
                go about this dental implant procedure. Preparatory Precautions You need to have 
                your implant surgery approved before anything else. Here are the steps that you 
                should expect to happen. In many ways, preparing for the implant takes longer 
                than the dental implant procedure itself.</h3><br />
                <br />


                <h2>Initial Consultation :</h2>
                <h3>You will first have to undergo a consultation with a prosthodontist before any 
                work is done. This specialist (or a general dentist with special training in 
                implant placement and restoration) will determine if you’re a qualified 
                candidate for implant dentistry or not.</h3>
                <br />
                <br />


                <h2>Comprehensive Examination :</h2>
                <h3>Your dentist will have you undergo an exam where he’ll review your dental and 
                medical history. He’ll also create impressions of your gums and teeth (for the 
                sake of creating teeth models) plus take dental x-rays of your jaw, particularly 
                the area where the missing tooth or teeth are.</h3><br />
                <br />


                <h2>CT Scan of the Mouth :</h2>
                <h3>There are also cases wherein a computer tomography scan (also known as a CAT or 
                CT scan) of your mouth is required that the dentist knows what he has to work 
                with. It assists him in determining how much jawbone is available for 
                implantation or if bone grafts are called for (particularly those who lack a 
                strong jaw or chin will need bone augmentation).</h3>
                <br />
                <br />


                <h2>Nerves and Sinuses :</h2>
                <h3>The CT scan also assists in locating structures such as sinuses and nerves that 
                should be avoided while doing implant surgery. The last thing you want to happen 
                is to suffer from nerve damage or break your sinuses while attempting to regain 
                the tooth that you’ve lost through restorative means. Bone Grafting If there’s 
                not enough bone in your jaw to hold an implant according to x-rays or the CT 
                scan, the dentist can discuss options for bone augmentation or buildup. As noted 
                in the earlier sections, grafting might be called for in order to ensure there’s 
                enough bone for the post to embed itself in. Otherwise, the dental implant 
                procedure might fail and end up dislodging itself when you apply the regular 
                biting forces of the human mandible unto your implant.</h3><br />
                <br />


                <h2>What to Expect with Bone Grafting :</h2>
                <h3>When it comes to augmenting your jaw, it typically involves taking bone from 
                other parts of your jaw/hip/chin, through a donor, or through artificial bone 
                material (calcium phosphate or hydroxyapatite) and adding it to your jaw so that 
                an implant can anchor itself deep into your mouth like a real tooth root. 
                Processed pig, cow, or human cadaver bone can also be utilized. What to Expect 
                with Bone Distraction: A bone distraction is different from a bone graft in that 
                it’s a surgical procedure that induces the body to grow more bone at the site 
                where it’s needed the most versus putting bone material there and fusing it with 
                your jaw. It involves using pins and screws to pull apart existing bone, which 
                causes your body to grow more bone to fill in the gaps.</h3><br />
